### Steps to create a _Virtual Environment_
- [Python Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
    - This is already available in the clusters node.
    - Do the following steps to create a virtual env.
        - `python3 -m vevn <name>`
        - `source <name>/bin/activate`
    - Now you are ready to install all your required libraries and it will be only in this environment.

### Steps to install the _requirements_
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Next steps

- Go into the src folder
- Download the ipynb
- Set the python environment to the virtual environment which has been created

Enjoy learning !!!
